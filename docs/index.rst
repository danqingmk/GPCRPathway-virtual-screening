GPCRPathway
===========

Welcome to the official documentation for GPCRPathway! This is the complete guide to using GPCRPathway, a specialized platform designed for discovering selective ligands targeting G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). 
Centered on the core strategy of integrating Su-GaMD pathway conformations with multi-stage virtual screening, 
this documentation details the full workflow from dynamic conformational capture of GPCRs to high-throughput ligand screening and validation.
